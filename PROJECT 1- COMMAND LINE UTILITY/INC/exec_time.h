     The code describes the time calculation algrithm.
     The function is called in multiple programs where we wish to display the time taken for execution in micro-seconds.
     [Calculation Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5248915/execution-time-of-c-program] 
     The template from the above link was used to develop our time calculation algorithm.
