     The code describes the algorithm to invert the value present at a memory location. .
     It is recommended, that the user invokes allocate('A'),writeto_memory('W'), display memory('D') commands before invoking this command.
     The user specifies the index of the memory location who's value should be inverted.
     The time taken for inverting the bits is given as the output.
